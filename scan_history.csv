In this chap-\nle on the basics; Chapters 12 and 17 cover more advanced uses\n\n1a discussion of memory addresses and their relationship to\nection 11.1), Section 11.2 then introduces the address and indi-\nection 11.3 covers pointer assignment. Section 11.4 explains\n§ to functions, while Section 11.5 discusses returning pointers\n\nables\n\n@ 4.\n\nWrite the following function:\n\nvoid swap(int *p, int *q);\nWhen passed the addresses of two variables, swap should exchange the values of the vari-\nables:\n\nswap(&i, &j); /* exchanges values of i and j */\n\nWrite the following function:\n\nvoid split_time(long total_sec, int *hr, int *min, int *sec) ;\n\ntotal_sec is a time represented as the number of seconds since midnight. hr, min, and\nsec are pointers to variables in which the function will store the equivalent time in hours\n(0-23), minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59), respectively.\n\nw f:°@x.~v\n\nIGO8 =oCBs\n\nThe first step in understanding pointers is visualizing what they represent at the\nmachine level. In most modern computers, main memory is divided into bytes,\nwith each byte capable of storing eight bits of information:\n\nEach byte has a unique address to distinguish it from the other bytes in memory. If\nthere are n bytes in memory, we can think of addresses as numbers that range from\n0 to n— 1 (see the figure at the top of the next page).\n\nAn executable program consists of both code (machine instructions corre-"
